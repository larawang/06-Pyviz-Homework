### Background ###
Harold's company has just started a new Real Estate Investment division to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. Harold was tasked with building a prototype dashboard and he needs your help. The real estate team wants to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the San Francisco market. If the new service is popular, then they can start to expand to other markets.
The goal of this dashboard is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in San Francisco.

In this assignment, I will help Harold accomplish the following tasks:

Complete a notebook of rental analysis.

Create a dashboard of interactive visualizations to explore the market data.

Create a dashboard of interactive visualizations to explore the market data.

### Rental Analysis
The first step to building the dashboard is to work out all of the calculations and visualizations in an analysis notebook.

### Housing Units Per Year
In this section, you will calculate the number of housing units per year and visualize the results as a bar chart using the Pandas plot function.
Note: By default, the limits auto-scale to the data. However, it is hard to see the difference between the yearly data. In the optional challenge, you can use the min, max, and standard deviation of the data to manually scale the y limits of the plot.
